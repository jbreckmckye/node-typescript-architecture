# Node TypeScript Architecture

(Work in progress, come back soon!)

![Logo](docs/logo.png)

This is the companion responsibility for the [Node TypeScript Architecture GitBook](https://jbreckmckye.gitbook.io/node-ts-architecture/).

NTA offers an opinionated architecture for writing Node.js applications, particularly in TypeScript (but will work with
plain JS too).

It offers a project structure, naming conventions, example code and recommended habits for building extendable, readable,
reliable systems in Node.js. You can use this architecture to build backend apps, CLI programs, REST APIs, GraphQL boxes
or even use it as part of an SPA.
